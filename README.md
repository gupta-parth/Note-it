# Note-it

## About
Note-it is a simple web application created using flask and javascript that allows users to create and store notes. It uses sql alchemy for database management and also some vanilla javascript for sending data from the front-end to flask. 

## Features
Note-it allows users to create minimalistic notes by using bootstrap cards. These cards display times and the notes itself. Along with that, there is user authentication page built into the app that allows users to securely store their notes. Here is a link to youtube video that demonstrates this project https://youtu.be/_N8WCnSw9iY.
